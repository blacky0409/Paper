abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have focused on log-structured file systems (LFS), because it gracefully enhances the random write performance and efficiently resolves the consistency issue. However, the write policy of LFS can cause a file fragmentation problem, which degrades sequential read performance of the file system. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between file fragmentation and the sequential read performance, considering the characteristics of underlying storage devices. We also propose a novel file defragmentation scheme on LFS to effectively address the file fragmentation problem. Our scheme reorders the valid data blocks belonging to a victim segment based on the inode numbers during the cleaning process of LFS. In our experiments, our scheme eliminates file fragmentation by up to 98.5\% when compared with traditional LFS.},

abstract = {File fragmentation has been widely studied for several decades because it negatively influences various I/O activities. To eliminate fragmentation, most defragmentation tools migrate the entire content of files into a new area. Unfortunately, such methods inevitably generate a large amount of I/Os in the process of data migration. For this reason, the conventional tools (i) cause defragmentation to be time-consuming, (ii) significantly degrade the performance of co-running applications, and (iii) even curtail the lifetime of modern storage devices. Consequently, the current usage of defragmentation is very limited although it is necessary.Our extensive experiments discover that, unlike HDDs, the performance degradation of modern storage devices incurred by fragmentation mainly stems from request splitting, where a single I/O request is split into multiple ones. With this insight, we propose a new defragmentation tool, FragPicker, to minimize the amount of I/Os induced by defragmentation, while significantly improving I/O performance. FragPicker analyzes the I/O activities of applications and migrates only those pieces of data that are crucial to the I/O performance, in order to mitigate the aforementioned problems of existing tools. Experimental results demonstrate that FragPicker efficiently reduces the amount of I/Os for defragmentation while achieving a similar level of performance improvement to the conventional defragmentation schemes.},

abstract = {As a file system ages, it can experience multiple forms of fragmentation. Fragmentation of the free space in the file system can lower write performance and subsequent read performance. Client operations as well as internal operations, such as deduplication, can fragment the layout of an individual file, which also impacts file read performance. File systems that allow sub-block granular addressing can gather intra-block fragmentation, which leads to wasted free space. Similarly, wasted space can also occur when a file system writes a collection of blocks out to object storage as a single large object, because the constituent blocks can become free at different times. The impact of fragmentation also depends on the underlying storage media. This article studies each form of fragmentation in the NetApp® WAFL®file system, and explains how the file system leverages a storage virtualization layer for defragmentation techniques that physically relocate blocks efficiently, including those in read-only snapshots. The article analyzes the effectiveness of these techniques at reducing fragmentation and improving overall performance across various storage media.},

abstract = {File fragmentation has been widely studied for several decades due to its detrimental effects on I/O activities. However, most of the previous research focuses on its performance aspect in a single application. In this paper, we analyze the effect of fragmentation on I/O control in a consolidated system where multiple applications run simultaneously. Our evaluation demonstrates that all of the weight-based I/O control mechanisms supported by the Linux kernel fail to achieve fair I/O sharing for different reasons when they meet fragmentation. Also, we show that defragmentation can promptly antidote such failures by preventing request splitting and device-level resource conflicts.},
