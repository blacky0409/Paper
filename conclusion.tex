\section{Conclusion} %{{{
\label{s:conclusion}

Contrary to the initial belief that filesystem fragmentation does not affect performance in SSDs, recent studies have revealed a correlation with performance degradation. 
These studies often employ forced aging of SSDs to reflect real-life environments, a process that can be time-consuming and may not positively impact research outcomes.

To address this issue, we aim to provide a method for quickly establishing an aged SSD environment for new research by copying and loading SSD information. 
Currently, our approach supports only conventional SSDs, but we plan to expand support for various types and capacities of storage devices in the future, thereby positively impacting research.
